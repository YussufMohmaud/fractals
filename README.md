# Fractals

![Alternate text](pics/fractals.PNG)

## Introduction

Fractals are generative, they are built with very complex pattern and they allow you to zoom in forever! In this repo I will see how easily it is to generate several kinds of fractals using a technique called L-Systems and the Python Turtle module for the step by step pen plotting.

## Overview

In this repo I'm not going to dive into too many technical details but instead I'll present drawings, a lot of animated examples and at the end, the code to generate these fractals. There will be some resources for both code and math background to explore at the end.
