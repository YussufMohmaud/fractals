# Fractals

## Introduction

Fractals are generative, they are built with very complex pattern and they allow you to zoom in forever! In this repo I will see how easily it is to generate several kinds of fractals using a technique called L-Systems and the Python Turtle module for the step by step pen plotting.

## Overview

In this repo I'm not going to dive into too many technical details but instead I'll present drawings, a lot of animated examples and at the end, the code to generate these fractals. There will be some resources for both code and math background to explore at the end.

## What's a Fractal?

First lets give a definition of what a fractal is, it is basically a geometric figure which shows the same characteristics no matter how much you zoom in; a recursive non-intersecting line.

A fractal is an object or quantity that displays self-similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales. The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same "type" of structures must appear on all scales. A plot of the quantity on a log-log graph versus scale then gives a straight line, whose slope is said to be the fractal dimension. - [Math World](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html)
